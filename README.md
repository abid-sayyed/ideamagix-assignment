## Organization Homepage Project

This project is the homepage for an organization, built using core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following features have been implemented:

- **Migration from Owl Carousel to tiny-slider:** Since Owl Carousel was deprecated, tiny-slider was adopted, recommended by Owl Carousel developers.
- **Lazy loading for images:** All images have lazy loading enabled, supported by modern browsers. Additionally, a JavaScript function has been implemented for browsers that do not support lazy loading.
- **Sticky form:** The query form is sticky, adhering to the institution's requirements.
- **Pure JavaScript implementation:** Certain features have been implemented using pure JavaScript for future-proofing.
- **HTML5 tags:** HTML5 tags have been utilized wherever applicable.
- **Hosting:** The site is hosted on Netlify.

I have endeavored to address all assignment requirements within the given timeframe to the best of my abilities.
